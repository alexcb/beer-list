Steel & Oak Brewing Co.,999,?,"Some people celebrate 1000... not us! Our 999th batch was brewed using 100% Bohemian Floor Malted Pilsner malt and a generous late hop addition of Saaz, MittelfrÃ¼h and Nelson Sauvin hops. For a little excitement, we added a strain of Brettanomyces from a 40-year-old bottle of Hochschule Berliner Weisse (harvested by our friends at Escarpment Labs) at bottling and then left them to slowly condition."
Steel & Oak Brewing Co.,De La Funk,?,Foeder-aged Belgian style golden ale. House Of Funk (North Vancouver) collaboration.
Steel & Oak Brewing Co.,Quinella 2019,?,Saison with guava and brett — this is Secretariat with a new name for 2019.
Stillwell Brewing Co.,Glou,6.3%,"A very special annual beer, Glou starts as a blend of the best of our cellar, many very diverse barrels of mature beer are added to a large quantity of freshly pressed NS-grown NY muscat grape skins for a 2-4 month re-fermentation. The result is a beautiful, pink, aromatic potion that makes us rather excited. The 2019 blend, which will come out this spring/summer, uses 1,000 lbs of NY muscat from Benjamin Bridge winery."
Stillwell Brewing Co.,"Make 1, 2",?,"BiÃ¨re de Coupage is something we've been interested in at Stillwell Brewing. Historically it's more of a practice than a style, usually cutting older, “stale” or sour beer into fresher beer either to add interest to the fresher beer or to find a home for a quantity of beer too stale or sour to drink on its own. Here we blended a single barrel of old, sour saison into a much larger portion of fresh Easy, and then dry-hopped the blend with some of our favourite hops."
Stillwell Brewing Co.,Posy,?,A special small-batch beer-wine blend of a single barrel of well-aged saison with 100 or so litres of Ortega wine from Blomidon Estate.

Strange Fellows Brewing,Little Red One,5.6%,"This West Coast Sour with black currants from the Fraser Valley, has been barrel-aged for over a year, blended with a 2014 Lambic-style ale and is partially bottle conditioned. The currants lend berry character but with a dry herbal note (rather than sweetness) â kind of like walking on ground cover herbs on a very hot, dry summer day. There are aromas and flavors of oak, black tea, and tobacco."
Strange Fellows Brewing,Mistral,6%,"This dry bright Saison was aged in ex-Riesling barrels with a unique Brettanomyces yeast culture. The result is a beer, not unlike the wine, with flavours reminiscent of lime, petrol and white grape."

Gueuzerie Tilquin,Gueuze Tilquin – Draft Version,5.3%,"A spontaneous fermentation beer obtained from the blending of a low alcohol lambic (called Meerts or March beer) with 1 and 2 years old lambics matured in oak barrels. Unfiltered and unpasteurized, it is re-fermented in kegs for a minimum period of 3 months. The lambics used were fermented and matured in our own oak barrels at the blendery, made from worts brewed by Boon, Lindemans and Girardin."
Gueuzerie Tilquin,MÃ»re Tilquin – Draft Version,4.8%,"This beer is a lighter version of our Oude MÃ»re Tilquin Ã  l'ancienne. Same recipe with 260g frozen blackberries per liter, but lighter in alcohol, due to the use of a blend of 50% Meerts and 50% 1 and 2 year old lambics."

A rich, balanced cider that was keeved over the winter months to retain a natural, residual sweetness."
Twin Island Cider,"Forage Fine Perry, 2018 Harvest",7.2%,"For this batch we boated to obscure islands, scaled fifty foot wild pear trees, and snatched golden, tannic fruit from under the noses of island sheep and horses alike. Pressed from astringent wild seedling pears, perry pears from Samuel Island and Louise Bonne de Jerseys from Old Orchard Farm on Pender Island, this is a proudly traditional perry. The pears were milled, macerated for six hours to soften the tannins, and fermented wild."
Twin Island Cider,"Hedgerow, 2018 Harvest",7%,"A sparkling Pender Island cider aged on whole summer plums and blackberries we picked from farm hedgerows around the island, as well as currants from Burnfoot Farm on Mayne Island. Ruby-hued and dry with a pleasantly tart finish, this batch evokes sun-warmed strawberries and golden straw on the nose and palate."
Twin Island Cider,"Homestead Blend, 2018 Harvest",7%,"We recreated a blend that would have been commonly found on homestead tables: Melba, Golden Russet, Winter Banana, and Gravenstein, along with a mix of English bittersharps from homesteads on Pender including our cidery orchard."

Twin Sails Brewing,Borealis,6.1%,"During the harvest season of 2018, we isolated a strain of lactobacillus off the skins of apples from Dominion Cider's orchards.

It was then blended with Dominion's wild fermented cider made from Aurora apples creating a harmonious blend of crispness and funk."
Twin Sails Brewing,Devilwood,6.7%,"Inspired by the cocktails of The Keefer Bar, we brewed a wild ale into second use bourbon barrels. Osmanthus flowers were then cold steeped in the beer briefly before packaging.

Twin Sails Brewing,El Cacto,7.9%,"Inspired by one of our favourite cocktails, the Margarita, this farmhouse style ale was fermented and aged in reposado tequila barrels for 8 months. We then rested it on a healthy dose of lime zest right before packaging to create a beer bursting with fresh citrus and floral notes balanced with a light acidity and tequila on the finish."
Twin Sails Brewing,Pollen,5.8%,"Pollen is an oak aged farmhouse Ale finished on honey. We brewed this beer using malt from the Skagit valley and locally sourced honey, then aged it for 8 months in Okanagan wine barrels.

Wild Ambition,A Single Branch,5.7%,"A Single Branch started its life as a Flanders inspired sour red. The beer underwent primary fermentation with red wine yeast, brett, & lactobacillus before laying to rest for five months in red wine barrels. 200lbs of gorgeous, Balaton sour cherries from Jobst-Hof Orchards (just a bit up the highway from the brewery!) were then popped into one of our stainless tanks. We transferred the beer on top of the cherries for 6 more weeks of conditioning. Over that period, the sugars in the cherries fermented out & we picked up a ton of flavour & colour - including vinous character from the prolonged skin contact."
Wild Ambition,Blending In,6%,"Our first biÃ¨re de coupage, this release was made with 40% mature oak-aged sour beer and 60% stainless steel fermented hoppy farmhouse ale. This blending ratio creates a beer that balances the bright, fresh, and moderately bitter hop character of the stainless portion with the tart, complex, and brett-forward flavours of the barrel aged sour portion. The blending, the barrel aging, and the fresh and modern dry hop with Amarillo, Citra, and Motueka make Blending In a prime example of what we do."
Wild Ambition,Imaginal Phase,5%,"With a seasonally appropriate warm and rustic rye flavour, this is our ode to traditional belgian style farmhouse brewing. Based on a classic saison, our twist is that we dose the beer with brettanomyces yeast strains on bottling day. This beer then undergoes a metamorphosis with the new yeast protecting the existing hop flavours while it adds its own wild and rustic expression over time. We kettle-hopped generously with Styrian Goldings and lightly dry-hopped with a carefully selected blend of Czech Saaz, German Tettnanger, and New Zealand Motueka."
Wild Ambition,Painted Caves,6.8%,"Painted Caves is a dark sour aged in french oak barrels that previously held BC red wines, it was allowed to slowly mature for months with a mixture of three strains of brettanomyces, our saison yeast, and lactic acid bacteria. Itâs deep brown colour with ruby highlights comes from a blend of the oak and a mix of UK and Belgian roasted and caramelized specialty malts to compliment the BC grown base malt. This beer was lightly dry hopped right in the barrels with UK Bramling Cross to help bring out the dried dark fruit character of the crystal malts."
Wild Ambition,Precipitous,5.4%,"This beer is, at its core, a brett saison/hazy IPA hybrid with a fair dose of oats and a softer carbonation to compliment the juicier aspects of the massive whirlpool and dry hop additions of tropical fruit forward Citra hops. Precipitous was fermented with a blend of 6 different strains of brettanomyces and our favourite strain of saison yeast."
Wild Ambition,Under the Sun,4.1%,"A light summer session ale, Under the Sun is a full mixed-fermentation sour wheat beer complimented by the addition of sweet orange, lemon, and grapefruit. We also dry hopped with a modest charge of El Dorado hops for a super bright tropical fruit aroma. Under the Sun is a beer to be paired with and inspired by the beautiful Okanagan summer sun. In many ways, this is our answer to the ubiquitous summer radler, but weâve got all those delicious sour and citrus flavours without all the extra sugar of unfermented soda blended in. This beer is bright, crisp, tart, and refreshing and is best enjoyed with friends while taking in the sunshine."
The Wild Beer Co.,Ceresa,4.6%,"This beer has come out of our shared love of wild yeasts, slow beers, local fruit and the beauty of barrel ageing. Our collaboration is as close to a rose beer as you can imagine; a beautiful pink rose-colour leads to a gentle aroma of sweet almonds, cherries, herbal notes of oregano and thyme with a nice hint of cranberry. This is a very delicate beer that explores balance fruit character whilst not overpowering the beers flavour. Loverbeer (Italy) collaboration."
The Wild Beer Co.,Rosa Rouge,4.6%,"A transcontinental barrel aged sour saison — the wild yeasts of Missouri have been flown to us to mingle with the Somerset beasties. Brewed without hops, we have incorporated the colour red with the additions of pomegranate and rose petals. Side Project (Missouri) collaboration."
The Wild Beer Co.,Wild Goose Chase,4.5%,"Juicy, tart gooseberries and our own culture of wild yeast from local orchards give this a gentle acidity. Whilst a generous dry-hop of complementary hops enhance the fruitiness and give a light but moreish bitterness."
