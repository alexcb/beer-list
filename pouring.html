				<h4>A Single Branch</h4>
				<p class="abv">5.7%</p>
				<p class="desc">A Single Branch started its life as a Flanders inspired sour red. The beer underwent primary fermentation with red wine yeast, brett, & lactobacillus before laying to rest for five months in red wine barrels. 200lbs of gorgeous, Balaton sour cherries from Jobst-Hof Orchards (just a bit up the highway from the brewery!) were then popped into one of our stainless tanks. We transferred the beer on top of the cherries for 6 more weeks of conditioning. Over that period, the sugars in the cherries fermented out & we picked up a ton of flavour & colour - including vinous character from the prolonged skin contact.</p>

				<h4>Blending In</h4>
				<p class="abv">6%</p>
				<p class="desc">Our first biÃ¨re de coupage, this release was made with 40% mature oak-aged sour beer and 60% stainless steel fermented hoppy farmhouse ale. This blending ratio creates a beer that balances the bright, fresh, and moderately bitter hop character of the stainless portion with the tart, complex, and brett-forward flavours of the barrel aged sour portion. The blending, the barrel aging, and the fresh and modern dry hop with Amarillo, Citra, and Motueka make Blending In a prime example of what we do.</p>

				<h4>Imaginal Phase</h4>
				<p class="abv">5%</p>
				<p class="desc">With a seasonally appropriate warm and rustic rye flavour, this is our ode to traditional belgian style farmhouse brewing. Based on a classic saison, our twist is that we dose the beer with brettanomyces yeast strains on bottling day. This beer then undergoes a metamorphosis with the new yeast protecting the existing hop flavours while it adds its own wild and rustic expression over time. We kettle-hopped generously with Styrian Goldings and lightly dry-hopped with a carefully selected blend of Czech Saaz, German Tettnanger, and New Zealand Motueka.</p>
			</li>

				<h4>Painted Caves</h4>
				<p class="abv">6.8%</p>
				<p class="desc">Painted Caves is a dark sour aged in french oak barrels that previously held BC red wines, it was allowed to slowly mature for months with a mixture of three strains of brettanomyces, our saison yeast, and lactic acid bacteria. Itâs deep brown colour with ruby highlights comes from a blend of the oak and a mix of UK and Belgian roasted and caramelized specialty malts to compliment the BC grown base malt. This beer was lightly dry hopped right in the barrels with UK Bramling Cross to help bring out the dried dark fruit character of the crystal malts.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Precipitous</h4>
				<p class="abv">5.4%</p>
				<p class="desc">This beer is, at its core, a brett saison/hazy IPA hybrid with a fair dose of oats and a softer carbonation to compliment the juicier aspects of the massive whirlpool and dry hop additions of tropical fruit forward Citra hops. Precipitous was fermented with a blend of 6 different strains of brettanomyces and our favourite strain of saison yeast.</p>

				<h4>Under the Sun</h4>
				<p class="abv">4.1%</p>
				<p class="desc">A light summer session ale, Under the Sun is a full mixed-fermentation sour wheat beer complimented by the addition of sweet orange, lemon, and grapefruit. We also dry hopped with a modest charge of El Dorado hops for a super bright tropical fruit aroma. Under the Sun is a beer to be paired with and inspired by the beautiful Okanagan summer sun. In many ways, this is our answer to the ubiquitous summer radler, but weâve got all those delicious sour and citrus flavours without all the extra sugar of unfermented soda blended in. This beer is bright, crisp, tart, and refreshing and is best enjoyed with friends while taking in the sunshine.</p>
